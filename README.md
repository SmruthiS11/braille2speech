# Braille to Speech Conversion
This repository contains the code to build a system, providing the blind with cost-effective and easy-to-use technologies, to convert Braille input to speech. The proposed system consists of two main subsystems : a) converting Braille input into text and b) text-to-speech (TTS) models for audio conversion, which is the final expected output. The objectives of this proposed system are to improve accessibility for visually impaired users, demonstrating promising accuracy and usability through user testing.
